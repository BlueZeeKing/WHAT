# WHAT

This mod turns the spyglass into the Sanctuary Guardian "WHAT" meme, complete with music! While there are resource packs which will also do this, they have a couple issues that this mod fixes. With this mod, the music is always at the same pitch, and will stop when you exit the spyglass. In addition, the player HUD will disappear while using the spyglass.
